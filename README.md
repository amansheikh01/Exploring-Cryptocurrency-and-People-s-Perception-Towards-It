<h1>Exploring Cryptocurrency and Public Perception: An Empirical Undergraduate Study</h1>

<p>
This undergraduate research project presents a <i>systematic and empirical examination</i> of
public awareness, perception, and adoption of cryptocurrency as an emerging
<span class="highlight">digital financial asset</span> within the contemporary economic framework.
The study is motivated by the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies and the
limited financial literacy surrounding digital assets, particularly in the
<span class="highlight">Indian socio-economic context</span>.
</p>

<h2>Research Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To analyse public awareness and understanding of cryptocurrencies</li>
    <li>To examine demographic and economic factors influencing adoption</li>
    <li>To evaluate perceptions related to risk, security, and regulation</li>
    <li>To model cryptocurrency purchase behaviour using statistical and machine learning techniques</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Collection and Methodology</h2>
<p>
Primary data were collected through a <b>structured online questionnaire</b> designed to capture
demographic attributes, financial satisfaction, awareness sources, investment behaviour,
and regulatory attitudes. The dataset was rigorously cleaned and preprocessed to ensure
statistical reliability.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Exploratory Analysis:</b> Descriptive statistics and data visualization</li>
    <li><b>Inferential Analysis:</b> Chi-Square Test for Independence</li>
    <li><b>Predictive Modelling:</b> Classification-based machine learning models</li>
</ul>

<h2>Analytical Techniques and Tools</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Statistical Tools:</b> Descriptive Statistics, Chi-Square Test</li>
    <li><b>Machine Learning Models:</b> Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes</li>
    <li><b>Software & Languages:</b> <i>Python, R, Excel</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Empirical Findings</h2>

<div class="result">
<ul>
    <li>A significant proportion of respondents reported <b>financial dissatisfaction</b>,
        correlating with higher interest in alternative assets.</li>
    <li><b>Price volatility</b> emerged as the most critical perceived barrier to adoption.</li>
    <li><b>Social media platforms</b> were identified as the dominant source of cryptocurrency awareness.</li>
    <li>Income level, occupation, and perceived popularity significantly influenced investment decisions.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The study highlights a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency as a potential financial instrument,
while simultaneously revealing a strong public demand for <b>institutional regulation</b>
to enhance trust and mitigate risk. The findings emphasise that awareness, economic security,
and regulatory clarity are fundamental drivers of long-term cryptocurrency adoption.
