<h1 align="center">Exploring Cryptocurrency and People’s Perception Towards It</h1>

<p>
This undergraduate research project presents a systematic empirical study of
public awareness, perception, and adoption of cryptocurrency as an emerging
digital financial asset. The study aims to understand how individuals across
different demographic, occupational, and income groups perceive cryptocurrency
in terms of risk, security, regulation, and its potential role in the future
economic system. The research is motivated by the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies
and the lack of widespread understanding among the general population,
particularly in the Indian economic context.
</p>

<p>
Primary data were collected through a structured questionnaire administered via
an online survey. The survey captured demographic characteristics, financial
satisfaction levels, awareness of cryptocurrencies, investment behaviour, and
attitudes towards regulation and future adoption. The dataset was cleaned and
analysed using statistical and machine learning techniques to ensure reliability
and interpretability of results.

<p>
Exploratory and inferential statistical analysis revealed clear demographic and
economic patterns in cryptocurrency adoption. A substantial proportion of
respondents expressed dissatisfaction with their current financial status and
demonstrated a higher willingness to invest in alternative assets, including
cryptocurrency. Price volatility emerged as the most significant perceived
obstacle, while social media was identified as the dominant source of awareness.
Income, occupation, and perceived popularity of cryptocurrency were found to
significantly influence investment decisions.
</p>

<p>
Inferential analysis using the Chi-Square Test for Independence established
statistically significant relationships between key socio-economic variables and
cryptocurrency investment behaviour. Furthermore, predictive modelling was
performed using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, and
Naive Bayes classifiers. Comparative evaluation indicated that Naive Bayes and
Logistic Regression achieved superior classification performance in predicting
cryptocurrency purchase behaviour, highlighting the relevance of probabilistic
and regression-based models for behavioural financial analysis.
</p>

<p>
The findings suggest growing acceptance of cryptocurrency as a potential
financial instrument, with a majority of respondents supporting regulatory
oversight to safeguard investments. The study concludes that awareness,
economic security, and institutional regulation play a crucial role in shaping
public confidence and long-term adoption of cryptocurrencies.
